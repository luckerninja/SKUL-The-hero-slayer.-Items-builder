        This is a beta version of the build designer in the game SKUL: the hero slayer. <br />
        You can drag and drop items into one of the inventory slots, thus evaluating inscriptions on different builds <br />
        Click on an item to read its description <br />
        The application is written in Vue.js, you are free to suggest your changes <a>github</a> <br />
        In the future it is planned:
        <ul>
            <li>Displays the percentage of physical damage / crit. Damage/Magic Damage/Attack Speed/Movement Speed</li>
            <li>Stylish pixel art styling</li>
            <li>load and save build functions</li>
            <li>Displaying percentages taking into account pumping at the witch</li>
        </ul>
        If you have suggestions for improvement, you can write to me on discord: Lucker#4416 or telegram: @luckerninja
